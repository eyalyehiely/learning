# Online Coding Web Application - Moveo Task

## Introduction

This project is designed to help students and mentors conduct remote coding sessions. 
by writing and changing the code in real-time. The application consists of two main pages: the Lobby page and the Code Block page.

## Features

### Lobby Page

- The Lobby page displays a list of code blocks.
- Users can choose a code block, which will navigate them to the Code Block page.

### Code Block Page

- The first user to open the Code Block page is considered the mentor, and subsequent users are students.
- The mentor sees the code block in read-only mode.
- Students can edit the code block, and changes are displayed in real-time using WebSockets.
- Supports JavaScript code only.

### Bonus Feature

- Each code block can have a “solution” field. If the student's code matches the solution, a big smiley face is displayed on the screen.

## General Guidelines

- Code blocks are created manually, with fields `title` and `code` (a string representing JS code).
- Clear comments are added to the code where needed.
- The project involves client, server, and database components and can be implemented using any framework/language.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **react-bootstrap**: 
- **@monaco-editor/react**: 
- **@mui/material**: 




- **Socket.IO**: For real-time communication between the mentor and student.

### Backend

- **Django**: For the backend server and handling API requests.
- **Django Channels**: For WebSocket support to enable real-time updates.
- **Django Rest Framework**: For building RESTful APIs.

### Database

- **PostgreSQL**: For storing code blocks and user data.
- **Redis**:

### Deployment

- **Railway**:

## Quick Start

### Backend

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/eyalyehiely/learning-backend/
    cd learning/backend
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    on macOS:
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    on Windows:

    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up the database (make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running):
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    on macOS:
    python3 manage.py runserver

   on Windows:
    python3 manage.py runserver
    ```
